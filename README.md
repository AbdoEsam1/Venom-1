# Venom : All Terrain Autonomous Quadruped

 #### Venom is  a 12-DOF unmanned Quadruped(four legged robot) equipped with RGB-Depth Camera and an ARM Processor for onboard computations.

  Most of the robots available in the industry make use of wheels for navigation. The goal is to build legged vehicle with multiple-terrain mobility  superior to existing wheeled and tracked vehicles. The system would be able to travel anywhere a person or animal  could  go using their legs while carrying its own fuel and payload. It would be smart enough to negotiate terrain with a minimum of human guidance and intervention. Path, trajectory, gait optimization algorithms, probabilistic algorithms along with inverse kinematics, Euler-Lagrange model for dynamically stable motion will be implemented on the system. 

####  By using a powerful tool like Robot Operating System, we can implement SLAM(Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to generate a map of its surrounding area which can be sent to a web app or an android app.
